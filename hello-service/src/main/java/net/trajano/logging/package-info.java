/**
 * <p>This package provides classes used for logging. This provides an example of what
 * operations may use.</p>
 * <p>The package does not provide a logging framework; JCL is the logging framework used.
 * JCL was chosen as it is already used by Spring.</p>
 * <p>This package eventually should just be moved to its own project as this would
 * be part of a set of common interceptors.</p>
